WHAT THIS MOD HAS IN DETAIL
========================
>	A full week with new character(s) including 3 original songs and 1 remix of the Tutorial
>	A background for each song based on the Week's story, including one for Tutorial Remix
>	ALT Mode difficulty features song charts that are more difficult and have diverse patterns (originally experimental charts)

v1.6.0 UPDATE:
-----------------
> Ported to Psych Engine!
> Fixes Parish's incorrect BPM
> Charts now different for each difficulty
> Custom modifiers moved to preferences submenu
> NOTE SPLASHES!
> Credits menu for, well, credits.
> this update resets settings again lol, sorry!
  > Cutscenes aren't yet available.

v1.5.0 UPDATE:
-----------------
> Implemented Kade Engine, not yet perfect as cutscenes haven't been added.
	> Allows ghost tapping, which means you can press without missing (CAN BE CHANGED IN OPTIONS MENU)
	> Options Menu (WITH CUSTOM MODIFIERS LIKE REANIMATED SPRITES AND ZAVODILA EFFECTS!!)
	> Allows custom keybinds.
	> Scores WILL be reset since it now uses ~\AppData\Roaming for save data.
	> Kade Engine settings WILL be reset since the app uses a custom filename.
> BRAND NEW CHARTS!
	> All difficulties are currently the same since I haven't gotten around to charting the rest lol
	> yeah you can't get the old ones lol
	> Fixed Zavodila having an incorrect BPM

v1.4.30.21 UPDATE:
-----------------
> Implemented newer version of Sarv Engine, which now has easier imput for doubles AND triples, and the crossfades are improved. Bounds are adjusted accordingly for late and early notes and the Accuracy math has been fixed to allow a fair accuracy (to prevent shit like having 100 misses and 90% accuracy, like wtf)
> Color coded ratings are now eye friendly since they were too bright last time
> Notes butched (pressing where there is no note at all) will not count as a miss and decrease your accuracy, however to keep the FNF spirit, it still does take down ur health by a little
> Crossfades now have movement and are more dynamic
> Stage Tints have been added on certain songs
> Added new song - Casanova, and character - Selever. He is annoying. Please shit on him before he shits on you.
> Scores may be reset on this version since it saves to a new save file to get some space for the new song
> Removed some easter eggs in the game files, you can check for yourself

v1.3.26.21 UPDATE:
------------------
> Implemented the Sarv Engine, which allows accuracy and ease in pressing notes for FNF, and also allows high bounds for late and early notes
	> Includes tracking of Misses, Accuracy(toggled), Rating and Deaths
	> Allows changing of control scheme to WASD,DFJK,QWOP and IJKL. All include the directions to work as well
	> Implements slowing down of what used to be 'echo notes'which means all notes too close to each other excluding doubles will slow down when the note before it is hit
	> Color coded ratings
	> Contains pattern support where patterns that a hit are read faster with less lag than normal
> Updated Sarv's sprite sheets to allow smoother animations for Idle animation and fixed the sliding bug
> Fixed the dialogue spam bug and typos
> Fixed the boyfriend's crossfade bug (slightly, which has been reduced to one crossfade)
> Recharted all the charts for Week + of all difficulties
> Freeplay bumpin scroll bug fixed
> Old charts are still accessible via Freeplay as -Alpha charts
> Added disclaimer for licensing and notice for misinformation
> Adjusted health gain/loss rate to normal (as the vanilla)
> FPS cap is now 128
> added new character: thicc Ruv

====================
EXTRA NOTES
====================
>	Charts may not work properly in the vanilla game or other engines, as the *.json now holds the Girlfriend version and noteskin.
>	I understand file digging, but unless you're a moderator or you're a helping dev, it's not really good to check for the files until you've actually played the mod (there is a lot in it??)
>	I hope you have fun and thank you for downloading!! Much appreciated!!
