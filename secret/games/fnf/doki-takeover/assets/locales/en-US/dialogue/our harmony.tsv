ohIntro1	As the last notes of Monika and Sayori’s song fade, Yuri and Natsuki walk back into the music room, both with bashful smiles on their faces.
ohIntro2	<Q>Ah, did we miss a special performance?<Q>
ohIntro3	<Q>Ehehehe, we were just celebrating with a song. With how great things have been, how can we not?<Q>
ohIntro4	<Q>Unfortunately we have to cut the celebration short, heh heh.<Q>
ohIntro5	<Q>Yuri and I were approached by the Music Club President, and they’re gonna need their room back real soon.<Q>
ohIntro6	<Q>That must mean it’s almost time for our own club meeting.<Q>
ohIntro7	<Q>I do feel bad that we keep using their space, but the acoustics in here are amazing. Perfect for singing or just thinking out loud.<Q>
ohIntro8	<Q>We got a little extra time before our club meet starts, so I have an idea!<Q>
ohIntro9	<Q>Let’s all sing together! Duets are nice, but imagine how we’d all sound harmonizing at once!<Q>
ohIntro10	<Q>Count me in. I’m more excited to do this than ever.<Q>
ohIntro11	<Q>Uhu, I’d love to join in as well.<Q>
ohIntro12	<Q>What say you, club president?<Q>
ohIntro13	<Q>Ahaha, of course I'm in!<Q>
ohIntro14	<Q>Okay, everyone! Let’s begin!<Q>
ohEnd1	The Literature Club girls conclude their song with laughter and cheer. The music room is alight with excitement and joy.
ohEnd2	<Q>I can’t believe we waited this long to all sing together! I wanna do this so much more often!<Q>
ohEnd3	<Q>There’s always plenty of extra time during club meetings to keep singing, and I’m more than excited to sing some more with everyone. We sound amazing together!<Q>
ohEnd4	<Q>Maybe next time we can get the other three to join us too.<Q>
ohEnd5	<Q>I haven’t seen any of them around. Do you think they’ll show up for the club meeting today?<Q>
ohEnd6	<Q>We’ll have to see.<Q>
ohEnd7	<Q>Actually, I just remembered-! Sayori, didn’t you have exciting news you wanted to share with us?<Q>
ohEnd8	<Q>Oh oh! I do! Thank you for reminding me!<Q>
ohEnd9	<Q>You guys aren’t gonna believe this, but you know how my friend keeps refusing to sing with us?<Q>
ohEnd10	<Q>I saw him in the clubroom with Boyfriend and Girlfriend, and I could have sworn I heard him singing!<Q>
ohEnd11	<Q>Heh heh, about time he gave in. I was gonna keep bullying that dope until he did.<Q>
ohEnd12	<Q>I’m surprised he stuck out not singing for so long. You think we’ll catch him mid-song if we all sneak in right now?<Q>
ohEnd13	<Q>Let’s go and see! To the club!<Q>
