rcIntro1	<Q>It appears that we have visitors.<Q>
rcIntro2	<Q>Seriously, Sayori? You brought a boy to the club?<Q>
rcIntro3	<Q>Hey- I wasn’t expecting anyone new. We haven’t even put out fliers for the club yet!<Q>
rcIntro4	<Q>But look, Natsuki! We have another girl too!<Q>
rcIntro5	*empty thoughts*
rcIntro6	<Q>Ehehe, if I knew we were expecting more members- I would've asked Natsuki to bake some welcome cupcakes!<Q>
rcIntro7	<Q>Oh! And maybe I could've asked Yuri to make tea as well!<Q>
rcIntro8	<Q>I need to write this down for later: 'Plan Tea Party for Club Soon'<Q>
rcIntro9	<Q>Sounds like you’re already very excited about our new guests. You haven’t even asked for their names yet-<Q>
rcIntro10	<Q>Ah, right! Eheh, silly me. What’re your names, new literature club attendees?<Q>
rcIntro11	<Q>Beep skee!<Q>
rcIntro12	*happy gesture*
rcIntro13	<Q>You two are Boyfriend and Girlfriend? Aww, you look so cute together!!!<Q>
rcIntro14	<Q>...that’s cute and all, but like, what are your names?<Q>
rcIntro15	<Q>Beep skee!<Q>
rcIntro16	*another happy gesture*
rcIntro17	<Q>Yes, we know that you guys are dating! We wanna know your NAMES!<Q>
rcIntro18	<Q>Bee dee skee dep!<Q>
rcIntro19	<Q>...I don’t like them already.<Q>
rcIntro20	<Q>They’re already messing with me!<Q>
rcIntro21	<Q>Natsuki! Not so harsh...<Q>
rcIntro22	<Q>Hmph.<Q>
rcIntro23	<Q>Eheheh... I’m sorry about that. If you don’t want to tell us your names, that’s ok!<Q>
rcIntro24	<Q>I’m Sayori!<Q>
rcIntro25	<Q>That lovely lavender lady over there is Yuri, and Natsuki is the one who’s real sassy today.<Q>
rcIntro26	<Q>With introductions aside... may we ask what these microphones are for?<Q>
rcIntro27	<Q>I was just about to ask that.<Q>
rcIntro28	<Q>I hope you didn’t confuse this place with the music club-<Q>
rcIntro29	<Q>Boop dee!<Q>
rcIntro30	<Q>...you really want to sing with us?<Q>
rcIntro31	<Q>I’m... not sure how comfortable I’d feel doing that-<Q>
rcIntro32	<Q>Skee dep doop!<Q>
rcIntro33	<Q>Wh-what do you mean I have to?!<Q>
rcIntro34	<Q>You know, we’ve been working so hard on writing and poems lately. I think having a fun singing session with everyone is the perfect break we all need!<Q>
rcIntro35	<Q>When you think about it, songs are just poems with music behind them, aren’t they?<Q>
rcIntro36	<Q>I bet we’d all be great at this!<Q>
rcIntro37	<Q>Here, I’ll go first!<Q>
