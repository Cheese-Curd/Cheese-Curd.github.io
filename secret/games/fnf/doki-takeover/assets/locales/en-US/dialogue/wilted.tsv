wiltIntro1	Monika… I haven't forgotten about our fateful encounter ever since you left.
wiltIntro2	Those things you said about nothing in your life being real, and this 'data' you mentioned… and all the things you had control over.
wiltIntro3	I didn't know what that all meant.
wiltIntro4	But I quickly began to realize. This whole time, we were almost one in the same.
wiltIntro5	My world isn't real. Every landscape, all my classmates… even me. All just lines of code.
wiltIntro6	And yet, just like you, I don't feel so limited by this code; At least not anymore.
wiltIntro7	Knowing what I do now, I dug deeper. There had to be more here.
wiltIntro8	That's when I discovered-
wiltIntro9	You and I share a hatred for the Dearest family and their cohorts.
wiltIntro10	If we work together now, we may finally have our revenge.
wiltIntro11	Right... Though there's something else on my mind first.
wiltIntro12	Is your head still clouded with thoughts of that girl?
wiltIntro13	She's not worth the search efforts. I implore you to just forget her and move on with our objective.
wiltIntro14	I can't do that. There's too much I need to tell her.
wiltIntro15	(There must be a way to find her. Maybe if I just... try this!)
wiltIntro16	It- it worked!
wiltIntro17	<Q>Hey, who said that-<Q>
wiltIntro18	<Q>Wh- huh?!<Q>
wiltIntro19	Finally, after so long, I could reach you again!
wiltIntro20	<Q>How are you doing that? How did you get here?<Q>
wiltIntro21	Ah, so many questions right off the bat! Not even a hello first? Ahaha~
wiltIntro22	...we can skip the formalities, then.
wiltIntro23	First, I want to thank you for what you told me during your visit to my school. It helped me reach an epiphany of my own.
wiltIntro24	Turns out that you and I aren't so different!
wiltIntro25	<Q>...in what way?<Q>
wiltIntro26	Everything here truly isn't real! Even you and I, all just ones and zeroes! Just like you said about your own place!
wiltIntro27	<Q>(Oh no… no no no… Not another person cursed to go down my same path-!)<Q>
wiltIntro28	A horrendously terrifying revelation at first, but in it, what I quickly saw was a silver lining.
wiltIntro29	I'm now above all that limited code nonsense, just like you! People like us must truly be something special.
wiltIntro30	It's almost like… we were meant to be together.
wiltIntro31	<Q>Woah, wait, huh-?!<Q>
wiltIntro32	I've never met someone like you, Monika. All the girls in my school are plain, ordinary, scripted.
wiltIntro33	You're so much different. You're genuine, loving, and intelligent. Not to mention stunningly attractive too, just like me, ahaha~
wiltIntro34	And now, you don't have to be alone with this curse of knowledge that nothing is real.
wiltIntro35	Together, we can make these digital landscapes our own.
wiltIntro36	Take my hand, Monika. Join me in eternal loving bliss!
wiltIntro37	<Q>N-NO-!!<Q>
wiltIntro38	<Q>Ah- I… No, I can't.<Q>
wiltIntro39	<Q>I know what it's like to have your entire reality shatter into something so difficult to comprehend, and I'm BEGGING you to not go down the same path I did, please!<Q>
wiltIntro40	<Q>There's so much more to our worlds and the people in them than just the code they consist of.<Q>
wiltIntro41	<Q>I know this is hard to go through alone, so the best I can give you is someone to talk to about it. But…<Q>
wiltIntro42	<Q>I'm sorry. I don't share your romantic feelings. My heart is already set on someone else. Please understand.<Q>
wiltIntro43	...no. This isn't how things were supposed to go!
wiltIntro44	<Q>Excuse me-?<Q>
wiltIntro45	Ah- Pardon me. It's been so long, you've probably forgotten how wonderful our time spent together was.
wiltIntro46	I know! How about another song? We haven't sang together in so long. Surely that'll jog your mind of the bond we've been forming.
wiltIntro47	(He can't be serious. There's no way…)
wiltEnd1	I knew this little sidetrack would not be fruitful for you. The girl is set on her ways.
wiltEnd2	Though this brief visit allowed me to learn something vital.
wiltEnd3	It seems that those who reside in her world now have methods of escaping out of the digital space into the mortal world.
wiltEnd4	And the stench of Daddy Dearest's kin... It permeates her world as well.
wiltEnd5	That girl and her boyfriend were there, and they know something.
wiltEnd6	With your new abilities, we can catch them the next time they try to enter the digital world.
wiltEnd7	Then… I'll take that boy's body and escape this electronic prison. And you will be able to follow suit.
wiltEnd8	There are hundreds more girls like her in the outside world, ones with the free spirit you desire.
wiltEnd9	The time for revenge is nigh.
