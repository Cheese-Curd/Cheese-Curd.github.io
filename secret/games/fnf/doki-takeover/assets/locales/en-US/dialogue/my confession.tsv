confEnd1	What a lovely performance that was! I knew you had it in you.
confEnd2	Today has been one of the only real times I've tried to sing in front of strangers.
confEnd3	I'm glad that all the practice had paid off.
confEnd4	I quite liked the song choice as well. Where is it from?
confEnd5	Oh! I... I wrote that song.
confEnd6	It's something I spend a lot of long nights working on. It was meant for someone who means a lot to me.
confEnd7	Unfortunately... a lot happened, and I lost my chance to sing it to them... 
confEnd8	I still don't know where I am now, so I don't know if I'll ever get to share it with them... 
confEnd9	-though I don't know if they'll even want to hear it.
confEnd10	Ah, such a tragic story you've found yourself entangled in.
confEnd11	I can promise that this place is one of no such tragedies.
confEnd12	I'll be around whenever you have a song in your heart that needs to be sang!

confEnd14	(Well. If I didn't end up here, it would've been the recycling bin instead...)
confEnd15	(I hope the others are okay.)
confEnd16	(Natsuki, Yuri, Sayori...)
confEnd17	(After what happened, I thought restoring their character files and leaving would be what's best for the club... and for the one I loved...)
confEnd18	Is something the matter?
confEnd19	Ah- I'm fine. I don't know what that was-
