bakaIntro2	*giggling*
bakaIntro3	<Q>Dee boo skeet~<Q>
bakaIntro4	<Q>Rgh-! STOP CALLING ME CUTE!!!<Q>
bakaIntro5	<Q>I don't need boys calling me cute too, that's extra embarrassing-<Q>
bakaIntro6	<Q>He's the only boy here, Natsuki.<Q>
bakaIntro7	<Q>Well... I've been meaning to ask a good friend of mine to join the club as well, but I bet that dummy is just gonna join the anime club instead.<Q>
bakaIntro8	<Q>I knew I should've tried something new.<Q>
bakaIntro9	<Q>Luckily, music like that isnâ€™t the only kind I listen to.<Q>
bakaIntro10	<Q>If there's anyone who knows how to subvert expectations, its me.<Q>
bakaIntro11	<Q>Hit it!<Q>
bakaEnd1	Those girls have been giving me dirty looks ever since I got here. Did I do something wrong?
bakaEnd2	Ah, I see you've noticed my darling fellow schoolmates.
bakaEnd3	I've gotten quite the flock of dedicated fans here.
bakaEnd4	It's only natural when you're the most popular individual in your school.
bakaEnd5	Looks like they're all jealous of you, being able to pique my interest so quickly.
bakaEnd6	They'd kill to just spend one fleeting moment with me. Unfortunately, they're just not worth my time. Ahahah~
bakaEnd7	That's... hmm...
bakaEnd8	You must have your own little fanbase where you come from, no? 
bakaEnd9	Some people say I do, but personally it feels like everything I did back at my school went completely under the radar.
bakaEnd10	I never set out to be popular, though. I just wanted to share my passions with anyone who wanted to listen.
bakaEnd11	And thanks to that, I met my amazing group of friends...
bakaEnd12	-agh!
bakaEnd13	(Did I just see-)
bakaEnd14	(But why..?)
bakaEnd15	You're doing that thing again, Monika. You know you can always tell me whatever's the matter.
bakaEnd16	I-I'm ok... I'm ok!
bakaEnd17	There's no need to worry about me, ahaha-
bakaEnd18	Ah, if you insist.
bakaEnd19	In that case, I'd like to know more about where you're from. You continue to intrigue me with each conversation.
bakaEnd20	I can try my best to do that, yeah.
bakaEnd21	(Is something happening that's causing these effects?)
bakaEnd22	(The game barely kept itself together when everyone wasn't there.)
bakaEnd23	(If something goes wrong-)
