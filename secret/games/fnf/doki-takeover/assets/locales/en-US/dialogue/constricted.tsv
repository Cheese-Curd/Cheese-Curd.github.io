consIntro1	<Q>Ah, Sayori! Yuri! Natsuki! You're back!<Q>
consIntro2	<Q>How was your time hanging with Boyfriend and Girlfriend in their hometown?<Q>
consIntro3	(Aha, I still can't believe that's their actual names. Even says so on their character files-)
consIntro4	<Q>I had a screaming competition with a rock star! And I totally beat them too.<Q>
consIntro5	<Q>They're inviting me back next week for a rematch. If I win, I get free tickets to their band's next show!<Q>
consIntro6	<Q>I had a lot of extra money to spend this week, so I ate dinner at a very nice restaurant not too far off from the city.<Q>
consIntro7	<Q>While I was there, I had a nice chat with someone who shared a... similar interest in collecting.<Q>
consIntro8	<Q>He also seemed very intrigued when I mentioned our two new club members in a conversation. I didn't want to pry, though.<Q>
consIntro9	(There's a lot of strange, fantastical people out there in the real world, it seems.)
consIntro10	(And somewhere out there, my true love... I still have not forgotten about them.)
consIntro11	(I'll go back and continue my search soon enough. There's... so much I need to tell them.)
consIntro12	<Q>Ah- sorry, I got lost in thought. What about you, Sayori? Did you meet any new friends on your trip?<Q>
consIntro13	<Q>It was amazing! I didn't even know all these places existed!<Q>
consIntro14	<Q>It's almost as if they popped up out of nowhere, ehehe~<Q>
consIntro15	<Q>I did meet a new friend, in fact! He's followed me around the whole time we were gone.<Q>
consIntro16	<Q>Eh-? That's... a little odd.<Q>
consIntro17	<Q>-But I'm glad you all found some great new friends!<Q>
consIntro18	<Q>Mhhmm! He followed me back here too! Wanna meet him? He's so cute!<Q>
consIntro19	<Q>Oh? S-sure! Bring them in!<Q>
consIntro20	<Q>Say hi, Zipper!<Q>
consIntro21	<Q>SKREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!<Q>
consEnd1	<Q>PUT THAT THING BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM OR SO HELP ME-!<Q>
consEnd2	<Q>Gwarrgh.<Q>
