svIntro1	Not too long after Natsuki took her leave, another familiar face entered the music room. A certain ‘lovely lavender lady’, to be exact.<Q>,
svIntro2	<Q>Ah, hopefully I’m not interrupting anything-<Q>
svIntro3	<Q>Yuri! No worries, I’ve just been pacing around, passing time until our next club meeting.<Q>
svIntro4	<Q>Mhhm. This may be a little odd for me to say out of nowhere, but…<Q>
svIntro5	<Q>-thank you.<Q>
svIntro6	<Q>Oh? What for?<Q>
svIntro7	<Q>With all we’ve been doing in the club, that discomfort I feel… trying to commit to presenting what I do in front of others.<Q>
svIntro8	<Q>It’s gradually subsiding the more we do things together as a club.<Q>
svIntro9	<Q>The writing, singing, and just… talking. It's all given me a much better alternative to… releasing my emotions.<Q>
svIntro10	<Q>I’m so happy to hear that, Yuri! I’ve noticed you stepping out of your comfort zone a lot more as of late, and your confident singing voice is always pleasant to hear.<Q>
svIntro11	<Q>Knowing that this club has been such a good place of self-improvement for you, I couldn't be happier to hear that.<Q>
svIntro12	Yuri breaks eye contact and looks away for just a second; A shy smile cropping up on her face.<Q>,
svIntro13	<Q>I wanted to celebrate this personal milestone with something special.<Q>
svIntro14	<Q>I… wrote my own song. This is new territory for my writing prowess, so I wanted to ask if you’d like to perform it with me here.<Q>
svIntro15	<Q>Just a little bit of peer review before I show the others.<Q>
svIntro16	<Q>I’d be honored!<Q>
svIntro17	<Q>Shall we begin? My vocal chords are already warmed up!<Q>
svEnd1	<Q>Woah, you’re already a natural songsmith. I know the others will love to hear this!<Q>
svEnd2	Yuri looks away shyly once again and giggles to herself.<Q>,
svEnd3	<Q>Uhuhu… I appreciate you giving me your time.<Q>
svEnd4	<Q>I’m going to rehearse a bit more on my own before our next club meeting.<Q>
svEnd5	<Q>I’ll see you then, Monika.<Q>
