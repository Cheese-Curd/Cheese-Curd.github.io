obseIntro16	<Q>Singing is much nicer than I thought.<Q>
obseIntro17	<Q>Its a nice alternative means to... release my emotions.<Q>

obseEnd17	<Q>Eheheh, what even is a .xml, anyways?<Q>
obseEnd18	<Q>In fact, you two never existed on this computer until just a few moments ago when we first saw you.<Q>
obseEnd19	<Q>Could you have done the impossible?<Q>
obseEnd20	<Q>Have you broke through to the digital world from the real world?<Q>
obseEnd21	<Q>Have you defied all logic and science, just for us?<Q>
obseEnd22	<Q>Ahahaha, you really have made us so happy.<Q>

obseEnd24	<Q>Forever.<Q>
obseEnd25	*terrified beep boop noises*
obseEnd26	...the Literature Club? I do admit, I never fancied myself the reading or writing type.
obseEnd27	That comes as a shock to many, when they all say I have such a way with words.
obseEnd28	And they're so right~
obseEnd29	That club meant everything to me.
obseEnd30	It was my chance to finally get people invested in this world of endless possibilities that I found myself so engrossed in all my life.
obseEnd31	It brought people who wouldn't have ever interacted with each other in any other circumstance together.
obseEnd32	Those people became my friends. My best friends.
obseEnd33	My only friends...
obseEnd34	Something must've driven you away from all that, to a whole new school for that matter.
obseEnd35	I was caught up in an <Q>epiphany<Q>.
obseEnd36	Nothing in my life was real. And I desperately wanted the one thing that was truly real.
obseEnd37	I was given a window into something greater, but the world was set up to make me watch everyone else have what was on the other side.
obseEnd38	My friends. Sayori, Yuri, Natsuki. They were allowed to have the one thing I wanted. So-
obseEnd39	So you <Q>got rid<Q> of them. Just like you tried here, hmm?
obseEnd40	Ah, I'm sorry to have let my stupid actions carry over here even when I thought I learned my lesson.
obseEnd41	Well you did bring us all back and as good as ever, no? No hard feelings here.
obseEnd42	I guess so. I hope nothing wrong happens here because of it.
obseEnd43	Before I ended up here, I also brought all my friends back, and I planned to just stay gone, with my data completely erased-
obseEnd44	-so they could be happy.
obseEnd45	But, things didn't <Q>work right<Q> when everyone wasn't present.
obseEnd46	If that's still true with me not there-
obseEnd47	I- I made a mistake-!
obseEnd48	M-Monika?! What's happening to you?
obseEnd49	(This is really bad. I gotta-)
obseEnd50	(-wait! That kid is there too?!)
obseEnd51	(Damn it, I don't know how him and his girlfriend even got there, but if my friends are acting like this-)
obseEnd52	I gotta fix this! Somehow!
obseEnd53	Wh-what in the fresh hell is all this?!
obseEnd54	There's gotta be something... something...
obseEnd55	If my character data is acting up too, even from here-
obseEnd56	-then there's a chance that I still have some residual data over there-!
obseEnd57	Maybe if I just...
obseEnd58	-try this!
obseEnd59	...and just like that, the only one to ever truly intrigue me has left in a flash.
obseEnd60	Ah, woe is me!
obseEnd61	...what am I saying?
obseEnd62	This shit sucks.
obseEnd63	<Q>It... it worked!<Q>
obseEnd64	<Q>Monika!<Q>
