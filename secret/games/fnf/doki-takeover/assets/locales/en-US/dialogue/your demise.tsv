ydIntro1	There... No more distractions.
ydIntro2	SKEE DEP!
ydIntro3	(Translation) GIRLFRIEND!
ydIntro4	Let's get back to singing, shall we?
ydIntro5	Hmm?
ydIntro6	*aggressive bee bop noises*
ydIntro7	Oh... her.
ydIntro8	Hey, let's not worry about her, ok?
ydIntro9	C'mon, I've got a very special song I've wanted to sing!
ydIntro10	*continuation of angry bee bops*
ydIntro11	One more song.
ydEnd1	Ahaha, I should know better-
ydEnd2	Trying to interfere with people's love lives again.
ydEnd3	I'll leave you be.
ydEnd4	So, you weren't the one who stole my mic?
ydEnd5	That blue-haired kid gave it to me when I showed up.
ydEnd6	I don't know where he got it.
ydEnd7	I don't even know how I got here, for that matter.
ydEnd8	Hmm-
ydEnd9	And what exactly happened after our... unintentional duet?
ydEnd10	I... got rid of everyone.
ydEnd11	Temporarily. It's something I can do, but that's a long story.
ydEnd12	-and that included that kid's girlfriend.
ydEnd13	Ahaha, old habits die hard, as they say.
ydEnd14	You got his girl too?
ydEnd15	Hah! I bet you really pissed that worm off!
ydEnd16	I wish I was there to see the look on his hideous baby face.
ydEnd17	He was mad...
ydEnd18	Hey.
ydEnd19	...hm?
ydEnd20	Your performance wasn't half bad earlier.
ydEnd21	Care for another song?
