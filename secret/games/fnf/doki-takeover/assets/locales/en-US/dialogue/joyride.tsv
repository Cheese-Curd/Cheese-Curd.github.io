joyIntro1	<Q>Hmm, Natsuki and Yuri both stopped by already, so I wonder-<Q>
joyIntro2	Monika’s words were quickly cut off by the sound of the music room door swinging wide open.
joyIntro3	Quickly running in was the Literature Club’s last major member, with a pep in her step.
joyIntro4	<Q>Ahaha, just as I thought! I’m happy you came to visit me too, Sayori.<Q>
joyIntro5	<Q>Ah, were Natsuki and Yuri here already??? Did I miss them??? Aww noooo, I had exciting news to share!<Q>
joyIntro6	<Q>Both of them did show up earlier to talk one on one with me.<Q>
joyIntro7	<Q>Though what's got you in super high spirits right now? Your smile is the biggest I’ve ever seen!<Q>
joyIntro8	<Q>Ehehe, I can’t help it! Everything we’ve been doing recently has been amazing!<Q>
joyIntro9	<Q>The festival went perfectly, and now we have seven amazing club members all making each other happy and positive!<Q>
joyIntro10	<Q>It's everything I could ever want: Everyone being happy and supporting each other.<Q>
joyIntro11	Sayori’s excited demeanor cools down, becoming more solemn but still with a genuine smile on her face.
joyIntro12	<Q>Seeing how much good we’ve been doing… It helps give me a reason to get out of bed every morning, knowing that we were able to accomplish this.<Q>
joyIntro13	<Q>It’s still hard for me to always keep those happy thoughts in mind, but it's getting better, bit by bit each day.<Q>
joyIntro14	<Q>It makes me more grateful each day that we were able to start this club.<Q>
joyIntro15	All the positive news and happiness from her friends had filled Monika with an overwhelming state of emotion.
joyIntro16	Tears welled up in Monika’s eyes while she listened to Sayori’s words.
joyIntro17	In a burst of melancholic happiness, Monika walks over and hugs Sayori.
joyIntro18	<Q>I’m… I’m so proud of you, Sayori. It means so much that you’re here with us to make this club the place it is.<Q>
joyIntro19	<Q>It’s helped so many people… especially me. Thank you…<Q>
joyIntro20	<Q>Ehehe… thank you too, Monika.<Q>
joyIntro21	After a few moments pass, the girls break off their hug. Monika wipes her tears and takes a deep breath.
joyIntro22	<Q>Aha- this is going to be a big shift in tone, but when the others came by earlier, they each sang a song with me.<Q>
joyIntro23	<Q>It would make me so happy to be able to do the same with you too.<Q>
joyIntro24	<Q>You don’t need to tell me twice! Let’s sing!<Q>
