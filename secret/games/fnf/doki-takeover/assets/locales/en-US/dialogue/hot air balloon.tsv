habIntro1	A few days since the festival… Monika stands alone in the school’s music room.
habIntro2	The Literature Club has been occupying the space a lot more since their recent club inductees introduced them all to singing-
habIntro3	-so much so that they often end up using the room more than the actual Music Club on occasions.
habIntro4	With her moment alone, Monika reflects on everything that’s happened recently.
habIntro5	<Q>It’s unreal just how… nice things have become.<Q>
habIntro6	<Q>I don’t know what I did to deserve a second chance, after everything I did before… but I know I’ll keep things right this time. For my friends.<Q>
habIntro7	<Q>Aha- back when it was just me left, I remember telling the one I love how I would’ve loved to have a rap artist join the club one day.<Q>
habIntro8	<Q>I didn’t expect that to actually happen, and for them to be the one to help save me and give me this extra chance. I can’t thank them enough.<Q>
habIntro9	Monika’s reflection is interrupted by the sound of footsteps entering the music room. A familiar pink-haired individual walked in.
habIntro10	<Q>Ah, Natsuki! I’m surprised to see you here! I expected you and the others to still be in classes.<Q>
habIntro11	<Q>I… I told my teacher I was taking a bathroom break. Though I actually left to go and find you.<Q>
habIntro12	<Q>I’ve been thinking about… stuff… recently. I wanted to come talk with you about it.<Q>
habIntro13	<Q>I’m always all ears! What’s on your mind?<Q>
habIntro14	<Q>I… I feel like I can’t keep up with you guys.<Q>
habIntro15	<Q>Oh? In what way?<Q>
habIntro16	<Q>I had that feeling deep down for a while, even as far back as when it was just the four of us in the club.<Q>
habIntro17	<Q>Now that the club has grown to seven members, and with the singing on top of that… I feel like I can’t compete-!<Q>
habIntro18	<Q>Everyone feels so much better and refined at singing, and I just can’t stand out among all the voices.<Q>
habIntro19	<Q>This club is one of the best things I’ve got right now as a comfortable place away from home, but this feeling of being overshadowed and thinking I have to try so hard to not be forgotten-<Q>
habIntro20	<Q>Natsuki- I can assure you, from the bottom of my heart, that you’re honestly one of our most stand-out writers and singers in the whole club!<Q>
habIntro21	<Q>I don’t think anyone can capture the unique style you bring to everything you do. And everyone knows it too!<Q>
habIntro22	<Q>The impression you leave in the club is too special to be forgotten, and we’d never want to leave you out.<Q>
habIntro23	Natsuki crosses her arms and looks away with an unsure expression.
habIntro24	<Q>I can prove it, too! Here, why don’t we sing a quick song? I can assure you, once you start getting into your flow, you’ll see what makes you so special.<Q>
habEnd1	<Q>That’s what I’m talking about! Those fast notes alone make you stand out so much, and when you consider everything else, that’s a whole bundle of stunning individuality!<Q>
habEnd2	<Q>…heh heh. That did help ease my mind.<Q>
habEnd3	<Q>You know what, next time I see that ‘Boyfriend’ guy, I’m gonna hit him with the fastest solo he’s ever heard! Hahaha!<Q>
habEnd4	<Q>Yeah, that’s how you do it!<Q>
habEnd5	<Q>I… really appreciate the help, Monika.<Q>
