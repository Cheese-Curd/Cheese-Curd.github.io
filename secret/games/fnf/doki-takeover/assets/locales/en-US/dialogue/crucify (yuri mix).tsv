crucIntro1	<Q>So, you two must be the other members that Monika and the other girls keep mentioning.<Q>
crucIntro2	<Q>They seem to know you quite well, even though I haven't seen either of you at a club meeting before.<Q>
crucIntro3	<Q>Well, I guess I did get roped into this whole Literature Club thing not too long ago, must've missed when you were around.<Q>
crucIntro4	<Q>I'm glad you showed up today though. Your whole singing thing has had the club really inspired.<Q>
crucIntro5	<Q>For the school festival later today, they decided to sing live as their club's special activity.<Q>
crucIntro6	<Q>Not sure what singing has to do with literature, but everyone seemed on board. Can't be upset at it, though.<Q>
crucIntro7	<Q>I haven't seen Sayori this happy in a while.<Q>
crucIntro8	<Q>I haven't had to go out of my way to wake her up for school nearly as much as I do, she's right outside with a happy smile waiting for me, humming happy tunes.<Q>
crucIntro9	<Q>But if you guys didn't show up, I would've had to be the one to sing with them. I'm not ready to embarrass myself in front of my peers like that yet.<Q>
crucIntro10	<Q>Plus, none of them could even figure out a song they wanted to duet.<Q>
crucIntro11	<Q>You think you guys can help them out?<Q>
crucIntro12	*happy gesture*
crucIntro13	<Q>Beep!<Q>
crucIntro14	<Q>A whole backlog of songs? That should give them all a nice selection to choose from.<Q>
crucIntro15	<Q>I'll let them know once they come back from prepping.<Q>
crucIntro16	<Q>And I'll see you two tonight at the festival.<Q>
crucIntro17	<Q>Audio is all set up, we're ready to go when you are.<Q>
crucIntro18	<Q>Thank you so much for helping us!<Q>
crucIntro19	<Q>It's funny seeing you managing all that music tech.<Q>
crucIntro20	<Q>Yeah! You're like our own personal MC!<Q>
crucIntro21	(In more ways than one, ahaha-)
crucIntro22	(Hmm... I wonder if that joke works in translation-)
crucIntro23	<Q>Oh, you're gonna go first, Yuri?<Q>
crucIntro24	<Q>Mhm...<Q>
crucIntro25	<Q>I found myself particularly immersed in the story of the track I picked.<Q>
crucIntro26	<Q>A song of two young lovers who wander into the shady parts of their lively hometown and come face to face with a monster.<Q>
crucIntro27	<Q>One ready to exact the will of God upon them.<Q>
crucIntro28	<Q>With a chainsaw.<Q>
