catIntro1	On one seemingly normal day in the Literature Club… Natsuki demonstrates her fast singing skills to fellow club member Yuri.
catIntro2	<Q>Hah, this 'rapping' stuff that Boyfriend loves so much ain't hard at all! All that time singing in the mirror really did pay off.<Q>
catIntro3	<Q>So fast, yet still so clear and rhythmic. I haven't seen anyone here be able to pull that off the way you do. I… I'd definitely get too overwhelmed and botch my words.<Q>
catIntro4	<Q>Hey, you're the one with the actually good singing voice, though. Faster doesn't always mean better sounding, y'know.<Q>
catIntro5	<Q>-but the conviction required to pull off such intense lyrical feats! I'm not nearly at that level yet! I'm confined to the slower, more standard melodies.<Q>
catIntro6	<Q>And what's wrong with that? You make them sound perfect! I'll sound bad if I even try to sing in your deeper tones!<Q>
catIntro7	<Q>Th-that's not true! You'd be able to get it down so easy! You at least have the confidence to try!<Q>
catIntro8	<Q>Geez, Yuri, just take the compliment already!<Q>
catIntro9	<Q>Putting yourself down is not a compliment-!<Q>
catIntro10	<Q>You're literally doing the same thing!!! Rrragh-! Fine! I'll prove you wrong right now!<Q>
catEnd1	<Q>Hah... what was that about you not hitting fast notes, Yuri..?<Q>
catEnd2	<Q>Huff... I see... I was correct about your conviction, though. No melody is too difficult for you.<Q>
catEnd3	<Q>Ehehe... You guys must be exhausted after that. Ooo! How about some tea and cookies?<Q>
catEnd4	<Q>Uhu... sounds lovely.<Q>
catEnd5	<Q>That... would be great.<Q>
