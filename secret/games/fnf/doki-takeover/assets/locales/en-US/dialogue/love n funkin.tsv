lnfIntro1	As fun as singing was, the Literature Club had soon gone back to their regular club activity of writing and poems when Boyfriend and Girlfriend departed.
lnfIntro2	Though every so often, the two would make their visit, and the pleasant bouts of song would return to the clubroom.
lnfIntro3	Today, however, was quite the unusual lineup of club attendees.
lnfIntro4	The two boys were absent, leaving today's meeting consisting of the original four girls...
lnfIntro5	and Girlfriend!
lnfIntro6	<Q>This is the first time I've ever seen you apart from your boyfriend.<Q>
lnfIntro7	*blank expression*
lnfIntro8	<Q>I was told that Boyfriend is acting as a vocal coach for a certain someone now. They must be occupied with that.<Q>
lnfIntro9	<Q>D-don't tell him I told you that though-!<Q>
lnfIntro10	<Q>Looks like it's just us today then!<Q>
lnfIntro11	<Q>Come to think of it, I honestly can't remember the last time we've had an all girls meeting.<Q>
lnfIntro12	<Q>Oooh, yeah! Actually, I've been wondering about this for a while, but hey Girlfriend!<Q>
lnfIntro13	*surprised look*
lnfIntro14	<Q>I don't think I've seen you participate in any of our club activities before. We'd love to have you get more involved!<Q>
lnfIntro15	<Q>You've been the quiet type, I've noticed. But I'm sure deep down there's so much you wanna say.<Q>
lnfIntro16	<Q>And this is the perfect place to write the way into your heart! Have you ever written a poem before?<Q>
lnfIntro17	*confused gaze*
lnfIntro18	<Q>If you haven't, we can teach you! We're basically poetry experts by now.<Q>
lnfIntro19	<Q>I wouldn't mind helping you to find your writing style. Writing your feelings down can help you express deep down what you may have trouble expressing vocally.<Q>
lnfIntro20	<Q>You've heard your boyfriend rap so much. Some of his rhymes had to have rubbed off on you.<Q>
lnfIntro21	<Q>Heck, I'm surprised I haven't heard you sing either considering how music centric he is.<Q>
lnfIntro22	<Q>That gives me another idea. Why not write a love song for Boyfriend? That way we can help you with writing and singing too!<Q>
lnfIntro23	<Q>Yeah, yeah! And what better way to help you write a song than to teach you with a song! Does that sound good?<Q>
lnfIntro24	*cheering*
lnfIntro25	<Q>Okay, everyone! It's time for a lesson I'll call...<Q>
lnfIntro26	<Q>Love n' Funkin'!<Q>
lnfEnd1	And through the power of song, Girlfriend was able to write down the lyrics to her very own love song for her darling Boyfriend.
lnfEnd2	The girls excitedly ask to see what Girlfriend had come up with, so she handed them the paper with all the lyrics written on it.
lnfEnd3	With much anticipation, the girls began to read, and-
lnfEnd4	-their expressions slowly morphed into ones of shock and confusion.
lnfEnd5	<Q>...I wasn't expecting you to write something so... explicit-<Q>
lnfEnd6	<Q>Eugh, eww!!! Why did you write that?! I don't need to know what you and your boyfriend do at night!<Q>
lnfEnd7	<Q>I'm... curious as to what inspired you to write down several verses about 'The blood of your enemies'-<Q>
lnfEnd8	<Q>Eheheh... ehhhhh... maybe next time, try to keep things school appropriate-<Q>
lnfEnd9	*blep*
